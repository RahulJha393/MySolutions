I have given ssolutions for some very basic problems of the tre data structure 

So the thing we are going to explore are :
 a) Create a tree
 b) Insert elements in the tree
 c) In Order Traversal
 d) Pre Order traversal
 e) Post Order traversal
 f) Level order traversal
 g) Height of the tree
 h) Sum of the values of all the nodes
 i) printing the leaf nodes
 j) Number of edges
 k) Printing top leaves (Leaves viewed from the top)
 l) Calculating the GCD of the child nodes in the tree
 
 If there is any other basic things that you wonna know just do let me know about that
